<MISSON4,5>


This program is a program that uses DS18B20 temperature sensor to transmit collected data to nodejs server and database.


The mainServer.js file builds the server and receives the data. The data is transferred back to the databases. It also saves the data in the data.txt file.


The mission4.py file transfers data collected using the DS18B20 temperature sensor to the thingSpeak site and the nodejs server.


The data.txt file contains the Celsius temperature values collected using the DS18B20 temperature sensor.
